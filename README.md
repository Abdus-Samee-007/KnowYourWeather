# KnowYourWeather

This document outlines the creation of a basic weather app utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a weather API.

### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* An account with a weather API provider (e.g. OpenWeatherMap)

### Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
    * CSS: Styles the layout and visual appearance of the app.
    * JavaScript: Adds interactivity and functionality to the app.
* **Backend (API):**
    * Weather API: Provides weather data for a specific location.

###  Project Structure

```
weather-app/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── images/
```

- `index.html`:  This file contains the main HTML structure of the weather app.
- `style.css`:  This file defines the styles for the app's layout and elements.
- `script.js`:  This file contains the JavaScript code that interacts with the weather API, fetches data, and updates the UI.
- `images/`:  This folder holds any additional resources like images. 


###  Content Breakdown

**index.html:**

This file will contain the basic HTML structure for the app, including elements like:

* Header: Displays the app title (e.g., "KnowYourWeather").
* Input field: Allows users to enter a city name.
* Button: Triggers the weather data fetch function.
* Weather information section: Displays fetched data like temperature, humidity, and weather description.
* Weather icon: Displays an image based on the weather condition.

**style.css:**

This file styles the HTML elements like:

* Layout: Defines the overall structure and positioning of elements.
* Font styles: Sets fonts for different parts of the app.
* Colors: Defines color schemes for text and background.

**script.js:**

This file contains the JavaScript code that interacts with the weather API:

1. **API Key:**  Store your weather API key securely (not in the code).
2. **User Input:**  Capture the city name entered by the user.
3. **API Call:** Build the API request URL using the entered city name and your API key.
4. **Fetch Data:**  Use the Fetch API to retrieve weather data from the API.
5. **Parse Data:**  Parse the JSON response from the API to extract relevant weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed etc.).
6. **Update UI:**  Update the HTML elements in `index.html`  with the fetched data.  This might involve modifying element content or adding/removing classes for styling. 

**Additional Notes:**

* Error handling: Implement error handling for cases where the API request fails or the city is not found. Display a user-friendly message in such scenarios.
* User Interface Enhancements: You can further customize the app by adding features like displaying weather icons based on the weather condition, showing forecast for multiple days, or implementing a location detection feature.
